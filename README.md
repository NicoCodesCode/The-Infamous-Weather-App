# 🌦️ Weather App  

Yep, another **Weather App**! Everyone seems to have one, so I decided to make mine too.  
The design might not be the fanciest, but the important part is that I learned how to use the **fetch** function hehe.  

This app uses the **Open Weather API**, so make sure to add your API key to the `apiKey` variable in the `script.js` file for it to work.  

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. **Clone the repository**  
2. **Set up your API Key**  
   - Go to the `script.js` file.  
   - Replace the `apiKey` variable with your Open Weather API key.  

3. **Run the App**  
   - Use a tool like **Live Server** to run it.  

4. **Check the Weather**  
   - Enter a location to see the current weather information. ☀️🌧️
