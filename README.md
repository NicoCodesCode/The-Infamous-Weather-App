# Weather App

So, you know how everyone has a Weather App? Well I made mine and I think it's pretty okay, the design not so much, but what matters is that I learnt how to use the fetch function so it's fine.  
I used the Open Weather API for this. Make sure to put your API Key in the apiKey variable located in the script.js file for it to work.  
Thanks.
